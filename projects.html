            <h3>Doom Game Engine in Java</h3>
            <p>
              The Doom Game Engine in Java project is a custom-built, Java-based
              game engine that I developed, inspired by the original Doom games.
              This engine recreates the retro 3D experience through essential
              game engine functionalities, including 2D and 3D rendering, Binary
              Space Partitioning (BSP) for optimized scene management, and basic
              player movement within a simulated 3D space from the 2D map. Built
              using JDK 21. Future expansions for the project could include
              features such as a map editor, AI-driven monsters, and a save/load
              functionality to enhance user experience. This project exemplifies
              core game development principles, from rendering to spatial
              partitioning, that I designed from the ground up.

            <h3>Blockudoku-AI</h3>
            <p>
              The Blockudoku-AI project is replication of the popular Blockudoku
              mobile game with a little twist, featuring an AI-driven player
              that makes strategic moves based on custom scoring rules. I
              recreated the Blockudoku game in Java and developed a rule-based
              AI to play the game autonomously. This AI isn't trained using
              machine learning but instead evaluates each possible move based on
              carefully designed scoring criteria, such as piece adjacency,
              connectivity to other pieces or walls, and alignment with
              horizontal, vertical, or 3x3 grid patterns. Built with Processing,
              this project demonstrates skills in game development, rule-based
              AI design, and algorithmic scoring. Future updates may include
              enhanced rule complexity and adaptive scoring for improved AI
              performance.

            <h3>Conway's Game of Life Simulator</h3>
            <p>
              The Conway's Game of Life Simulator project is a recreates the
              iconic cellular automaton developed by John Horton Conway in the
              1970s, offering an interactive exploration of this zero-player
              game. This simulator, built with Processing, allows users to
              observe how simple rules lead to complex behaviors and patterns
              across a grid. The program simulates "cells" that evolve across
              generations based on Conway's four basic rules, showcasing
              phenomena like oscillators, still lifes, and spaceships.
